% I created this template to write notes, handouts, summaries, and actually
% even my thesis (after adjusting the cover page) in LaTeX. 
% The template is organized as follows: inside the "Chapter" folder you 
% should place all .tex files containing the body of the document; 
% inside the "Figure" folder you should obviously place all the figures used 
% in the document. If the document is particularly long,
% I recommend organizing the figures into subfolders named after the 
% corresponding .tex file. The file "Bibliography.bib" is clearly the 
% bibliography of the document (I use biblatex), and the last important 
% file is "NotesTemplate.sty", which can be seen as the complete list of 
% packages (organized by theme) and commands that I usually use, or that are
% generally useful for writing a scientific document.

% Note that inside the "Chapter" folder there is also "Title page", which
% of course contains the code for the title page. This folder also contains 
% an image. The file "00-Legal Info.tex" is used to store (and print) the 
% legal protection information regarding the distribution of the notes.
% An Italian version is also available.

% The template is organized so that you write the various chapters separately 
% and then include them in the main file using the command \input{...}, 
% after the already included introduction chapter
% (\include{Chapter/1-Introduction}).

% When you decide to use this template, you need to know which parts to
% modify before starting to write your text:
% 
% main.tex : \title{} , \author{} , \date{} , \epigraph{quotation}
% Bibliography.bib : your reference texts
% Title page.tex : Figure
% 00-Legal Info.tex : Course , Professor
% 0-Preface.tex : Course , Professor , academic year , write the 
% appropriate description , "last update"
