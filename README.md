# LaTeX_Template
LaTeX template for university courses.

This repository contains a basic/medium template used take and publish notes of lectures of the theoretical physics degree at University of Turin.
It is organized like a book and designed for a full course. Most of the notes I’ve written using this template are around 300 pages long. Its only purpose is to provide an appealing layout.

## Features

In the template you'll find:
- `main.tex`
- `Legal Info.tex` : where you can write your license information.
- `Preface.tex`
- `Introduction.tex` : a first chapter to show an example.
- `Bibliography.bib`
  
## Usage
1. Open the `main.typ` file
2. Customize the configuration following all the instruction.
3. Write your own `.tex` file and compile.
